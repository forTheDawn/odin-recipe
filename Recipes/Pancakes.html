                <ul>
                    <li> 1 ½ cups all-purpose flour </li>
                    <li> 3 ½ teaspoons baking powder </li>
                    <li> 1 tablespoon white sugar </li>
                    <li> ¼ teaspoon salt, or more to taste </li>
                    <li> 1 ¼ cups milk </li>
                    <li> 3 tablespoons butter, melted </li>
                    <li> 1 large egg </li>

                        Steps:
                    </h3>

                        <ol>
                            <li> Sift flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt together in a large bowl. Make a well in the center and add milk, melted butter, and egg; mix until smooth. </li>
                            <li> Heat a lightly oiled griddle or pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake; cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, about 2 to 3 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side. Repeat with remaining batter. </li>
                        </ol>
